# Operational-Risk-Event-Prediction
Developed a classification model to predict operational risk events in banking processes, leveraging machine learning algorithms to streamline internal controls and improve risk identification accuracy.

Key Features
Predictive model using Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms.
Performance evaluation with confusion matrix metrics (precision, recall).
Bias testing to ensure fairness across operational units.
Project Structure
data_preprocessing.py: Prepares the operational logs for model input by cleaning, encoding, and scaling the data.
model_training.py: Implements the classification model and performs hyperparameter tuning.
model_evaluation.py: Evaluates the model using precision, recall, and fairness metrics.
notebooks/: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and initial prototyping.
results/: Stores performance metrics and evaluation reports.

Outcomes
Reduced false positives in risk identification by 20%.
Enhanced fairness in risk predictions across operational units.
